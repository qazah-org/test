The explore section of our template set is all about getting to know markdown and to learn some fun tricks and tips along the way. 

First of all you will learn about **frontmatter**, which is important metadata used in every single ‘.md’ file. This includes for example author, title and creation date.
 
Secondly, you will learn how to put content on the Developer Portal by **creating new articles** with Markdown and Hugo. 

The next step is, to explore some basic **markdown syntax for text** and **images**. You will see, Markdown is not only really intuitive, it also makes your content stand out and engaging to read!

Finally, you will dive right into **shortcodes**. Shortcodes allow you to become creative and offer you completely new options to display your content on the Developer Portal.
