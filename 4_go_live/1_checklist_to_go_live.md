Are you ready to go live? Please go through this list and check if your project fulfills all the acceptance criteria first. This is necessary to ensure that our users get the best use out of the Developer Portal and that your documentation can become a real esset in a developerâ€™s everyday work. 

## Project structure
Each project is different so there is **no strict regulation** on how to structure your documentation. Quite contrary, it is completely up to you!
To go live just set an initial structure. This structure is not final. Later on, you and your team members will be able to add new articles into existing structures.

**Just an example**
```
1. Overview  
2. Getting Started
3. Explore
4. Develop
5. Support
6. News
```

## Content 
The content from this template is just to help you getting started on the Developer Portal. You can delete, move or rename the folder and the articles inside this template (see some exceptions [here](./../1_gettingstarted/1_template_structure)). You can always find all this information in our writers' guides on the [support section](https://developer.bmwgroup.net/support) of the Developer Portal.
{{% note %}}
There is no need to have a final version of your content! You can go live with some basic content.

## Project description 
To display your project among other projects on the documentation page ([project overview ](https://developer.bmwgroup.net/docs)) a short but precise description of your project is required. Please write 1 - 2 sentences which give a first insight into your project.

**Bad examples:** 
{{% error %}}
- Documentation for _project name_ 
- Documentation, tutorials, guides and feature description for the _project-name_ 
{{% /error %}}

**Good examples:**

Find further information on how to change the project description [here](./../3_contribute/1_update_project_description/).

## Project category 
We have already added your selected categories during the initial project set-up but you can change them anytime yourself. But please keep in mind: 

- Please do not select more than 4 categories from the list - The project tile will not look good!
- Do **NOT** delete the category tag from the root _index.md! If you do the project will disappear from the overview
- Spelling is important!  Please test the filter in the overview after your changes 

Find further information on how to update your categories [here](./../3_contribute/1_update_project_description/).


## Community links 
Displaying your contact information in the navigation bar makes it easier for users to engage with your project and give you valuable feedback. It only takes you a few minutes, but it will make a huge difference for every member of the Developer Portal community. </br>

Find further information on how to add or update your community links [here](./../3_contribute/2_update_community_links/).


## Technical checklist 
1. All changes are on master branch! 
2. Work on your own machine! Your documentation works locally


## Hurray! You are ready to go live!
