## Welcome 
{{% medal %}}
Welcome on the Developer Portal! We are so happy to have you here! We are a community portal that relies on people like you who want to share their work, collaborate and inspire others. 
{{% /medal %}}

We have created this repository for your project documentation. 
</br> 
If you are familiar with HUGO Framework and Markdown syntax you can start right away and restructure and redesign this template content in the way which suits your project the most. 

{{% warning %}}
But be careful! There are still some folder and files, which you should not delete (see [here](./1_gettingstarted/1_template_structure)).
{{% /warning %}}

## New to HUGO and Markdown syntax?
Not familiar with Hugo or Markdown yet? No need to worry! We have created a selection of templates to guide you. You will find information on how to create a new article, learn some basics about the Markdown syntax and have the possibility to engage in exercises to deepen your knowledge.


{{% note %}}
But where to begin? Simply start with the **Getting Started** folder in your project repository.

All this content can also be found on our [support page](/support/). So if you need to look up any information after deleting the templates, simply browse through our [Master Your Contribution Section](/support/).
